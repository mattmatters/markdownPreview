# [Calculator-Redux](https://mattmatters.github.io/calculator-redux/)

This is a fully functioning chain-based calculator.  This was made primarily for myself as an exercise in using redux's state management combined with React's rendering capabilities.


## Installation

Assuming you already have yarn:

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/mattmatters/calculator-redux.git"
cd calculator-redux
yarn install
```

Upon installing you may type `yarn start` to run the application through a dev server.
