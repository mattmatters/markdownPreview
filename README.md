# Markdown Preview

This is a single page client-side web application that converts markdown into html using [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked)

## Installation

We reccomend yarn as a package manager to take advantage of the lockfile present

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/mattmatters/markdownPreview.git"
cd markDownPreview
yarn install
```

Upon installing you may type `yarn start` to run the application through a dev server.
